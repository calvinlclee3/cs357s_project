# (name, iir, tracking_logics_sig1|commit_cond, tracking_logic_sig2|commit_cond, ...) separated by empty lines
# tracking_logic_sig is hierarchical signal name without any operators 
# while commit_cond is an expression and treated as either 1'b0 or 1'b1
# we enumerate cross-prodct of tracking_logics_sig and commit_cond to derive all
# possible performing locations for a tuple of (iir, tracking_logics)
